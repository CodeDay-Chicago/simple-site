# Javscript & Canvas Workshop
## Javascript
### Before we begin...
**Javascript, ECMAScript, JS, ES** is a programming language for websites and web applications.
It has multiple versions. In a nutshell:
* Pre-2015 Javascript is *bad*
* Post-2015 Javascript, aka ECMAscript 6, is *good*, so that's what we're learning

Remember that Google is an excellent tool for looking up *anything*.
A good website for all-things Javascript is the [Mozilla Developer Network](developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs).

### Basics & Syntax
The obligatory 'Hello World!' script in JS:
```js
console.log('Hello World!')
```
**Variables** store data for the program. There are two ways to declare them:
```js
const number = 3  // can't change later on
let number = 3    // can change later on

// old javascript, gross, don't use it
var number = 3
```
Declaring only needs to happen once, so you should never redeclare variables.
```js
let number = 3
let number = 4 // error
```
**Semicolons** are not needed in javascript unless you want to add multiple statements onto a single line

You can change variables by using the format: **name = value**, but make sure that the variables have been declared!
```js
myBool = false
myInt = 4
myString = 'Heres some more text!'
```

**Operators** modify or test variables. They consist of

| Operator | Action
|-
| `=, +=, -=, *=, /=` | Assigns a value and applies any given arithmetic operator
| `===` | Tests equality
| `+, -, *, /` | Standard arithmetic
| `<, >, <=, >=, !=` | Comparing values
| `&&, ||, !`| Logical and, or, and not

**Conditional Statements** There are a number of conditional statements in JS:

`if` statements test whether a condition is true and can be followed by an `else if` or `else` statement if the initial if statement is not true.
```js
let i = 2
if (i === 0) {
  i += 2
} else if ( i === 1 ) {
  i++
} else {
  i -= 1
}
```
`for` loops iterate over a number a set amount of times. `while` loops iterate while the conditional statement given is true.
```js
// ( Iterator | Condition | Increment )
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
// Executes while j is less than 5
let j = 0
while (j < 5) {
  j++
}
```

Use **functions** in order to encapsulate a certain task combining a certain set of instructions into an easily accessable piece of code. There are multiple ways of defining functions:
```js
function add (a, b) {
  return a + b
} // use this for global functions

const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b
} // use this for inline functions
```

### Implementing Javascript in a Webpage
Remember HTML? Well we need to **link** our script to the HTML file to load the script. You can do this in multiple ways:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script1.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- DOM/HTML -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script2.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
There are two scripts:
* `script1.js` loads before the DOM is loaded
* `script2.js` loads while the DOM is being loaded

Some online code snippet editors like Codepen automatically link your scripts

### Modifying HTML

`document.getElementById('id')` gets an HTML DOM object. You can change certain attributes of the element, for example the inner HTML of the element, by using `document.getElementById('id').innerHTML = 'Hello World'`. This would change the HTML that is nested inside of the element that you get to text which reads "Hello World".

You can also create elements using  `var element = document.createElement("element")` and set it as a child of another object with `originalElement.appendChild(element)`

Theres a ton of other things in modifying HTML with JS, but we want to push you to use react, which allows you to do this in a much more streamlined way.

---
### Object Oriented Programming!

Object oriented programming uses **classes** which define objects. Think of it as making your own type of variable.
```js
//class declaration
class Car {
	//insert code for the class
}
```

**Constructors** function as a template when initializing an object. Think of it as setting the parameters/blueprint for your object.
```js
class Car {
	constructor (mileage, model, color) {
		this.color = color
		this.miles = mileage
		this.model = model
	}
}
```

Use **methods** as a function that can only be called by your object.
```js
class Car {
  /* other code */
  changeMileage (miles) {
    this.miles += miles
  }
}
```

You can then use the template of the constructor to store an instance of your object as a variable. Think of it as filling in the holes that were in your blueprint.
```js
let myCoolCar = new Car(2000, 'Zippy 2.0', '#FF0000')
```

### Canvas
todo: organize code
Now we will be interacting with a thing called **Canvas** which is a simple viewport where you can easily render 2d objects. Add a Canvas object using the `<canvas>` tag
```html
<body>
  <!-- DOM/HTML -->
  <canvas id="c"></canvas>
</body>
```

Now the rest of the work will be done in JS. First we need to set up the parameters of our canvas. This sets up the width and height of our canvas, initializes it, and sets up some easy variables for us to access in the future. The ctx variable is going to be the variable that we are going to draw things to. The keys variable is where we will store the keys that are currently pressed down.
```js
const VIEWPORT_WIDTH = 250
const VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = 250

let keys = []
c = document.getElementById('c')
c.width = VIEWPORT_WIDTH
c.height = VIEWPORT_HEIGHT
ctx = c.getContext('2d')
```

Now we are going to define a clear function, which will define the background of our canvas. We need this to call on every frame in order to clear the entire screen and redraw it.
```js
function clear () {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, VIEWPORT_WIDTH, VIEWPORT_HEIGHT)
}
```

Now we need to create a **Game Loop** which will infinitely run our game. At the moment it just infinitely redraws our background every frame.
```js
function GameLoop () {
  clear()
  gLoop = window.requestAnimationFrame(GameLoop)
}
window.requestAnimationFrame(GameLoop)
```
`window.requestAnimationFrame` tells the browser to run the function on the next animation frame.

Now we want to define a **Player Class** which can be reused for multiple players. This will have parameters inside of the constructor so that we can differentiate between different players. There are also methods that will do important functions for the game.
```js
class Player {
  constructor(pos, speed, color) {
    this.pos = pos
    this.startx = pos[0]
    this.starty = pos[1]
    this.speed = speed
    this.color = color
  }

  move (dir) {
    if(dir === 'up') {
      this.pos[1] -= this.speed
    } else if (dir === 'down') {
      this.pos[1] += this.speed
    } else if (dir === 'left') {
      this.pos[0] -= this.speed
    } else {
      this.pos[0] += this.speed
    }
  }

  bndCheck (width,height) {
    if (this.pos[0] < 0) {
      this.pos[0] = 0
    } else if (this.pos[0] > 230) {
      this.pos[0] = 230
    }

    if (this.pos[1] < 0) {
      this.pos[1] = 0
    } else if (this.pos[1] > 230) {
      this.pos[1] = 230
    }
  }

  render (ctx) {
    ctx.fillStyle = this.color
    ctx.fillRect(this.pos[0], this.pos[1], 20, 20)
  }

  playerCollide (player) {
    return ((this.pos[0] < player.pos[0] + player.pos[0]) &&
            (player.pos[0] < this.pos[0] + 20) &&
            (this.pos[1] < player.pos[1] + 20) &&
            (player.pos[1] < this.pos[1] + 20))
  }
  reset () {
    this.pos[0] = this.startx
    this.pos[1] = this.starty
  }
}
```

Now lets initialize two players. One red and one blue:
```js
player1 = new Player([0, 0], 2, '#0000FF')
player2 = new Player([220, 220], 4, 'FF0000')
```

We will also want to get information about keypresses which we store into the keys array
```js
document.body.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    keys[e.keyCode] = true
})
document.body.addEventListener('keyup', function (e) {
    keys[e.keyCode] = false
})
```

Now we implement the player **input, movement, and rendering** into the Game Loop
```js
function GameLoop(){
  clear()

  //player 1
  if (keys[38]) {
    player1.move('up')
  }
  if (keys[40]) {
    player1.move('down')
  }
  if (keys[37]) {
    player1.move('left')
  }
  if (keys[39]) {
    player1.move('right')
  }
  //player 2
  if (keys[87]) {
    player2.move('up')
  }
  if (keys[83]) {
    player2.move('down')
  }
  if (keys[65]) {
    player2.move('left')
  }
  if (keys[68]) {
    player2.move('right')
  }
  player1.bndCheck(VIEWPORT_WIDTH, VIEWPORT_HEIGHT)
  player2.bndCheck(VIEWPORT_WIDTH, VIEWPORT_HEIGHT)
  player1.render(ctx)
  player2.render(ctx)
  if (player1.playerCollide(player2) || player2.playerCollide(player1)) {
    player1.reset()
    player2.reset()
  }
  window.requestAnimationFrame(GameLoop)
}
window.requestAnimationFrame(GameLoop)
```
